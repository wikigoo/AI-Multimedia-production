### Survey Note: Comprehensive Development of a Journalist Assistant Using Open Source Tools

  

#### Introduction

The development of a versatile assistant for journalists using open source tools, deployable locally on Windows, and accessible via the local network, addresses the growing need for productivity and efficiency in journalism while ensuring data privacy. This survey note explores the process, tools, and considerations for building such an assistant, leveraging insights from available resources and aligning with the requirements for journalism tasks.

  

#### Background and Context

Journalism tasks often involve online research, news writing, video production, photo processing, text-to-speech conversion, and transcription, all of which require tools that are both efficient and privacy-focused. Deploying an assistant locally on Windows ensures that sensitive data, such as interview recordings or drafts, remains secure and does not rely on external platforms. The assistant must be accessible via the local network to facilitate collaboration among journalists, and it should be scalable and easy to update as journalism standards evolve.

  

#### Selection of Base Platform: Jan

After evaluating several open-source AI assistants, **Jan** ([Jan Official Website](https://jan.ai)) emerges as a suitable foundation. Jan is described as an open-source alternative to ChatGPT, running 100% offline on your device, with 3.2 million downloads and built-in public by a core team of 13, with over 46 contributors and 2,800 pull requests. It supports features like chat with AI for productivity, a model hub for choosing AI models, a local API server for integration, and highly customizable extensions ([Jan Documentation](https://jan.ai/docs)). Its compatibility with Windows is confirmed, with specific hardware requirements like AVX2 support and minimum 6GB VRAM for GPUs ([Windows - Jan](https://jan.ai/docs/desktop/windows)). Jan's extensible architecture, similar to VSCode and Obsidian, allows for adding custom features, making it ideal for tailoring to journalism needs.

  

#### Integration of Required Features

To meet the specific requirements, we integrate additional open-source tools into Jan, ensuring all components are deployable locally and accessible via the network:

  

- **Online Research Assistance**: Jan's chat capabilities can handle research tasks, and we can integrate journalism-specific tools identified in resources like newsrewired ([15 open-source tools journalists can use to improve their reporting - newsrewired](https://www.newsrewired.com/2017/11/22/15-open-source-tools-journalists-can-use-to-improve-their-reporting/)). Tools like **Web Mii** ([Web Mii](http://webmii.com/)) for tracking people online, **WhatDoTheyKnow** ([WhatDoTheyKnow](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/)) for FOI requests, and **OpenCorporates** ([OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/info/about)) for company data can be accessed via custom extensions, leveraging Jan's API for network access.

  

- **News Writing Support**: Jan's chat interface supports brainstorming and drafting, and we can integrate data visualization tools like **Open Refine** ([Open Refine](http://openrefine.org)) for cleaning datasets and **Datawrapper** for visualizations, as listed in the newsrewired article. These tools help journalists analyze and present data effectively, enhancing news writing efficiency.

  

- **Video Production Capabilities**: For video production, we integrate **FFmpeg** ([FFmpeg Official Website](https://ffmpeg.org/)), an open-source multimedia framework widely used for video editing tasks like trimming, merging, or format conversion. We can develop a Jan extension to control FFmpeg via commands, ensuring local processing and network accessibility.

  

- **Photo Processing and Editing Tools**: For photo processing, we use **OpenCV** ([OpenCV Official Website](https://opencv.org/)) or **Pillow**, both open-source libraries for image manipulation. A custom Jan extension can provide interfaces for tasks like resizing, cropping, or applying filters, all processed locally and accessible via the network.

  

- **Converting Written Text to Synthesized Audio**: For text-to-speech, we integrate an open-source TTS model like **Tacotron 2** ([Tacotron 2 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2)), which can be run locally on Windows. This ensures journalists can convert articles or scripts to audio, enhancing accessibility and production workflows.

  

- **Transcription Services for Video and Audio Content**: For transcription, we use **Whisper** ([Whisper GitHub Repository](https://github.com/openai/whisper)), an open-source transcription model that can process audio and video files locally. A Jan extension can handle file uploads, transcription, and return results, ensuring privacy and network accessibility.

  

#### Deployment and Network Accessibility

Jan's local API server feature, which can be set up with one click ([Jan Documentation](https://jan.ai/docs)), allows the assistant to be accessed via the local network. This ensures multiple journalists can interact with the assistant from their own devices, facilitating collaboration. Installation on Windows involves downloading Jan from its official website or GitHub repository ([Jan GitHub Repository](https://github.com/menloresearch/jan)), ensuring compatibility with system hardware, and configuring the API server to listen on a network interface.

  

#### User Interface and User-Friendliness

Jan provides an intuitive chat-based interface, designed for minimal technical expertise, which aligns with the requirement for user-friendly interfaces. Custom extensions for transcription, TTS, video, and photo processing can be integrated into this interface, ensuring a unified experience. For example, journalists can upload an audio file within Jan, trigger transcription via Whisper, and receive results without switching tools. This design minimizes the learning curve, especially for non-technical users.

  

#### Data Privacy and Security

All operations, including Jan's AI models, transcription with Whisper, TTS with Tacotron 2, video processing with FFmpeg, and photo editing with OpenCV/Pillow, are performed locally on the Windows machine. This ensures that sensitive data, such as interview recordings or drafts, remains secure and is not sent to external servers, meeting the priority for user data privacy and security. Optional cloud AI connections in Jan are disabled to maintain local operation, ensuring compliance with privacy standards.

  

#### Scalability and Updates

Scalability is addressed by running Jan on a more powerful machine if needed, such as one with higher RAM or GPU capabilities, to handle larger datasets or complex tasks like video processing. Updates are facilitated by Jan's open-source nature, with new versions available on GitHub ([Jan GitHub Releases](https://github.com/menloresearch/jan/releases)), and custom extensions can be updated independently to incorporate new features or improvements, ensuring the assistant evolves with journalism standards.

  

#### Documentation and Modular Architecture

Documentation will include detailed installation and setup instructions for Jan, covering hardware requirements, API server configuration, and usage guides for each feature. For example, it will detail how to install Whisper for transcription, integrate Tacotron 2 for TTS, and use FFmpeg for video tasks. The modular architecture, leveraging Jan's extensions, allows seamless integration of features, ensuring journalists can add or modify functionalities as needed without disrupting the core assistant.

  

#### Success Criteria and Testing

Success is measured by deploying the assistant on a Windows machine, ensuring accessibility to multiple users on the local network, and confirming all integrated features function with predefined journalism tasks, such as researching a topic, writing an article, transcribing an interview, editing a video, and processing photos. Positive feedback from journalists on usability and efficiency improvements will validate the assistant's effectiveness, with testing conducted to ensure all components work seamlessly.
